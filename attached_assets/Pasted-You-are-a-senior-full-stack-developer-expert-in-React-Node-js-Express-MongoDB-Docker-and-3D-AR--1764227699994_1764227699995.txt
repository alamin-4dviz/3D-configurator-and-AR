You are a senior full-stack developer expert in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Docker, and 3D/AR tech.

Build a complete, production-ready full-stack app with these features:

---

# Project Overview

1. Two user types: Regular Users and Admin.

2. Regular Users:
- Upload 3D models (OBJ, FBX, GLB, STL).
- Select device type (iOS → USDZ, Android/Other → GLB, or Both).
- Backend converts uploaded model accordingly.
- AR viewer with <model-viewer> for users (Quick Look for iOS, WebXR for Android).
- Temporary uploads auto-deleted on reload/close/new upload.
- Can browse Admin-uploaded models (visible ones) and view in AR.

3. Admin Users:
- Full dashboard with CRUD for 3D models + assets.
- Upload default GLB model, textures, materials, color variations.
- Store configurator metadata: parts, textures, colors.
- Toggle model visibility.
- Manage uploaded files and metadata.
- Metadata structure example:
  {
    parts: ["body", "wheels", "interior"],
    textures: { leather: ["black", "brown"], metal: ["silver", "gold"] },
    colors: ["#ffffff", "#000000", "#ff0000"]
  }

4. Future-ready configurator:
- Material swapping
- Color changing
- Part toggling
- Save user configurations
- Export configured model to AR

# Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + Zustand (or Redux), Three.js ready, responsive UI, admin dashboard, AR viewer.
- Backend: Node.js + Express, file upload, device-based conversion (fbx2gltf, gltf-transform, gltf-to-usdz), authentication with JWT, temp and permanent storage, admin CRUD APIs.
- Database: MongoDB with schemas for AdminModels, ConfiguratorMetadata, etc.
- Storage: /tmp for temp uploads, /public/admin-models, /public/admin-textures, /public/admin-config.
- Dockerized backend and frontend, with full dev and production setup instructions.

# Requirements for your output

1. Provide full folder structure (frontend + backend).
2. Provide backend code: Express server, API routes, file upload + conversion, admin CRUD, auth, temp file handling.
3. Provide MongoDB schemas/models.
4. Provide frontend code: upload UI, device selection, AR viewer, admin dashboard, configurator components, state management.
5. Provide Dockerfiles and docker-compose for easy local and production deployment.
6. Provide README with setup and run instructions.
7. Write clean, modular, production-quality code with comments.
8. Deliver the project **step-by-step**, starting from backend setup, then frontend, then integrations.

---

Start by generating the **full folder structure and the backend server.js** with upload API scaffold and MongoDB connection.

Wait for my confirmation before proceeding to frontend.

Keep replies concise, only code or structure unless I ask for explanation.
